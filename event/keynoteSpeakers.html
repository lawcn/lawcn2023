                                           <p>Dravet syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder which causes a catastrophic form of epilepsy. It is characterized by prolonged febrile and non-febrile seizures within the first year of life, 
                                              which progress to other seizures, and psychomotor delay. In most cases, the mutations associated with the disease are not hereditary (nonsense mutations 
                                              in the SCN1A gene, which codifies for NaV1.1). Accordingly, non selective anticonvulsant sodium channel blockers are known to aggravate seizures and status epilepticus in Dravet patients. 
                                              Taking inspiration on recent success in the development of small molecules capable of selectively inhibiting the NaV1.7 subtype, we currently pursue the identification of highly selective NaV1.2 or NaV1.6 
                                              blockers that do not inhibit NaV1.1, as potential treatments for Dravet syndrome. For that purpose, machine learning models based on random subspace approximations, linear classifiers and ensemble learning, 
                                              have been developed using NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 as targets and NaV1.1 as antitarget. The models have been applied in retrospective virtual screening campaigns, with  very good enrichment metrics, and are currently 
                                              applied complementary with structure-based approximations in the prospective virtual screening for new potential drug candidates against Dravet syndorme.</p>

                                        <p> Abnormally strong synchronization of neuronal activity is a hallmark of several brain disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
                                            In PD patients, permanent high-frequency deep brain stimulation suppresses symptoms during stimulus delivery. A qualitatively different, 
                                            theory-based approach uses dedicated patterns of electrical stimuli delivered to brain tissue to cause a desynchronization-induced decoupling 
                                            of oscillatory neurons, intending to move neural networks from attractors with abnormal neural synchrony to more physiological (desynchronized) attractors. 
                                            Corresponding cumulative and long-lasting therapeutic and desynchronizing effects were demonstrated in animal and clinical studies. </p>
                                        <p>By replacing invasively delivered electrical bursts with non-invasively administered vibratory bursts, we have developed a non-invasive approach: 
                                            Vibrotactile Coordinated Reset (vCR) stimulation delivered to the fingertips was designed to treat PD patients by inducing long-lasting desynchronization. 
                                            In a feasibility study, six PD patients were treated with vCR stimulation delivered for four hours per day for three months. Patients’ conditions were evaluated 
                                            after medication withdrawal (‘off medication’) by means of standard clinical scores and EEG recordings before and after the 3-month vCR treatment. 
                                            In accordance with vCR-related computational studies, months-long vCR therapy causes a statistically and clinically significant reduction of PD symptoms off medication
                                            together with a significant reduction of high beta (21-30 Hz) power in the sensorimotor cortex. The ultimate goal of this approach is to induce sustained symptom relief by non-invasively

                                        <p>The brain builds active predictions that allow inferring causal relationships in received sensory signals (Friston, 2005). These predictions are derived from the history of sensorimotor interactions with the world. Our perception can be understood as the result of real-time comparisons of information 
                                            transmitted in sensory input signals with previously constructed activity patterns in the brain or priors (Sterzer et al., 2018). These patterns would explain why perceptual organization follows certain principles (Gestalt laws), as it happens during the conjunctions made between elements, necessary for the segmentation of surfaces or objects. 
                                            The concept of priors is easily applicable to vision in two
                                            of its fundamental aspects: the perception of form and the perception of movement. Here, the possibility that simple visual priors are specifically constructed by the functional connectivity within the visual cortex will be discussed. In order to gather potential evidence for this hypothesis,
                                            data from our lab and others about the selectivity of long-range visual horizontal intrinsic and callosal connections, are presented and reviewed. Both networks selectively link distributed neuronal groups with similar response properties and the actions exerted by callosal input reflect the functional topography of those networks.
                                            Reversible deactivation studies strongly support that close to the representation of the visual field’s vertical meridian callosal networks affect in particular neurons which prefer potentially “midline crossing” features. Callosal connections seem to facilitate interactions between neurons with receptive fields along horizontal motion or (shape)
                                            trajectories crossing the visual field’s midline before a stimulus arrives. We propose that feature-selective lateral connections in general might exhibit a “cardinal bias” to interconnect neurons preferring vertical and horizontal contours. Those connections could support a spontaneously active network which pre-activates neurons along motion or shape trajectories frequently occurring in daily vision. 
                                            Finally, the cardinal biases in frontal-eyed mammals are compared to the horizontal biases frequently observed in later-eyed mammals.</p>

                                        <p> With the increasing number of successful applications of Machine Learning algorithms in several application domains, 
                                            including Computational Neuroscience, there is a strong interest in these algorithms easily accessible by users without Machine Learning expertise. 
                                            There have been several efforts in this direction, involving not only the recommendation of the most suitable algorithm, but also their most appropriate hyper-parameter values and working pipeline. 
                                            These efforts started a new research area, named Automated Machine Learning, AutoML, which has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners not only from academia, 
                                            but also from several companies working with Data Science  and Machine Learning.  This talk will present  the main approaches and recent advances in this area, 
                                            covering also works carried out in the Analytics Laboratory, at USP São Carlos.</p>

                                        <p>This talk will present a transient model to automatically detect neuromodulations in field potentials collected from the brain.
                                           The big advantage of the methodology is that it creates marked point processes directly from EEG, ECoG and LFPs that have high temporal 
                                           resolution unlike the current approach using short term Fourier transforms. Moreover, the marked point processes for the neuromodulations can be easily 
                                           integrated with neural firing providing multiscale quantification of brain activity, which facilitates relations to behavior. 
                                           We will present several examples of the new model in behavior experiments.</p>

                                        <p>Memory is a biologically fundamental function essential for survival; it has the
                                            ability to retain information and recall it a later time. Furthermore, memories give
                                            us identity, guiding our thoughts and decisions, as well as influence our
                                            emotional behavior. Within the brain, memory is a dynamic property of
                                            populations of neurons and their interconnections. Our memories are not all
                                            created equally strong since some experiences are well remembered while
                                            others are not, depending on various factores such as emotion. Memories can
                                            be classified in explicit (e.g. declarative) and implicit (e.g. procedural).
                                            Memories are also classified according to time: from short-term memory, lasting
                                            only seconds or minutes, to long-term memory, lasting months or years, being
                                            that the last involves mechanisms more complex with the consolidation and
                                            recall. Each memory system has a distinct anatomical organization, where
                                            different parts of the brain are recruited during phases of memory storage. Is
                                            this normal memory loss or the onset of dementia? Normal forgetting, in
                                            contrast to pathological forgetting that occurs in disease and with aging, is
                                            necessary for the functioning of a healthy brain as important as the ability to
                                            remember. The importance of forgetting, which involves the loss of information
                                            over time, is a relatively new concept for science. From numerous fields
                                            revealing that there are separate mechanisms biochemistry and molecular
                                            within neurons and, probably, also within glia (astrocytes): some for memory
                                            and the other for forgetting. These findings point to new way that helps us to
                                            undertand the neurobiology of memorry and forgetting.</p>

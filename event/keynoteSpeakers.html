                                        1988-1990 Neurology – Epilepsy at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA. He acts in the field of
                                        Physiology-Neurophysiology, mainly in an integrated form in the following themes: Behavioral, Electrophysiological, and
                                        Molecular Evaluation of Alterations of the Motor Control, among them Epilepsies, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,
                                        Parkinson´s and Alzheimer´s diseases, mostly in experimental models. I study also Auditory Plasticity, Sensory-Motor and
                                        Sensory-Limbic integration, and Complex Systems in Neurosciences. More than 33 years of experience at USP, published
                                        more than 130 articles, 9 book chapters. He did seminal studies with detailed characterization of behavioral sequences
                                        displayed by rats with acute and chronic audiogenic seizures, in Status Epilepticusand electrical amygdala kindling. He
                                        also pioneered the use of neuroethology and complexity (graph analysis) in behavioral sequences of temporal/frontal lobe
                                        seizures in patients from our Epilepsy Surgery Center. Synchronized video-EEG protocols helped to characterize

                                        students currently under supervision. In fact, from 2013 to 2016, he was the Director of the Ph.D. Program in
                                        Physiology, at the School of Medicine and because of its impact in the formation of hundreds of PhDs in Physiology

                                        <p>He completed his Ph.D. and first post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Plymouth, UK; followed by post-doctoral
                                        research at Johns Hopkins and SUNY Downstate. His research focuses on understanding cortical circuits through
                                        large-scale biophysically-detailed simulations on supercomputers. Dr. Dura-Bernal has developed detailed models of motor
                                        and auditory cortical circuits by integrating experimental data available at multiple scales -- molecules, neurons,
                                        networks, and systems. The models provided insights into cortical dynamics and helped develop new hypotheses and guide
                                        experimentation. He also developed a software tool (www.netpyne.org) for the multiscale modeling of brain circuits. It
                                        has already been used worldwide in over 40 labs, to train students and to investigate different brain regions and
                                        phenomena. Dr. Dura-Bernal has published over 30 peer-reviewed papers and was invited to present his work at the 2018
                                        Google Next supercomputing conferences in London and San Francisco. He received the 2019 Robert Furchgott Scholar Award
                                        for Excellence in Research, an early career investigator prize; and the 2017 Best Use of AI Award from HPCwire, a
                                        leading supercomputing publication. Dr. Dura-Bernal has obtained funding for his research from the NY State Spinal Cord
                                        Injury Board, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). In 2019 he was awarded
                                        a 5-year $1.2 million NIH grant (single PI) on multiscale modeling of brain circuits. As an educator, Dr. Dura-Bernal
                                        developed a new curriculum in Computational Neuroscience and has taught this course at SUNY Downstate and NYU. He is
                                        regularly invited to teach international courses and tutorials. Dr. Dura-Bernal mentors and trains several postdocs,
                                        graduate students, and interns in the lab. He is committed to outreach and diversity, which made him join the NY Academy
                                        of Science STEM program to teach neuroscience to underrepresented middle school students in Brooklyn. </p>

                            University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, where she was a Professor with the Department of
                            Electric Power Engineering, from 2008 to 2014. She is currently a Professor with the Department of Engineering
                            Cybernetics, NTNU. Starting in 2015 and after 12 years of working on the stability of power electronics systems, she has
                            gradually expanded her research area into non-linear and non-stationary signal analysis, from the domain of harmonics in
                            power systems into the domain of biological systems, specifically EEG signals. For that purpose, her group is now
                            developing computational models of the human brain for solving the EEG inverse problem and generic platforms for
                            non-linear and non-stationary signals analysis suitable for both physical and biological systems (electrical grids, EEG
                            signals). Molinas is an Editor of the IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics, Associate
                            Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, and an Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion. She
                            has been an AdCom Member of the IEEE Power Electronics Society from 2009 to 2011.</p>
